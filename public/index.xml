      <description>What is a Static Site Generator? A static site generator is a tool that takes a set of files and generates a static website from them. The files are usually written in a markup language like Markdown or HTML. The generator then takes these files and generates a website from them. The website is then hosted on a web server. The website is easily updated by simply updating the files and re-running the generator.</description>
