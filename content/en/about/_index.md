### History

The team was founded in 2000 in collaboration with L'Anse Creuse Public Schools and was called G.E.A.R.S. In that time we have competed almost every year with a break for the 2010-2011 seasons as we were without a coach. The team rebranded as a rookie at that time and became the Rockem Sockem Robotics team. We inherited alot of out of date hardware, some machinery and have been competing ever since.
