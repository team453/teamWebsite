## What is Outreach?

Outreach is the process of reaching out to the community and sharing our knowledge and passion for STEM. We do this by doing local outreach events and participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition. FIRST puts a lot of emphasis on outreach and we do too. We believe that outreach is a very important part of the FIRST experience and we want to share our knowledge and passion with the community.

### What is FRC Zero?

[Link to frczero.org](https://frczero.org)

FRC Zero is a collaborative knowledge hub that is maintained by FIRST Robotics Competition teams. The website is a resource for students, mentors, and teachers to learn about the FIRST Robotics Competition. The website is maintained by the students of FRC 453 and others. The website is open source and the code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/frc0/frc0site). The hosting is provided by [Mr. Siefen's Robot Emporium](https://www.mrsiefensrobotemporium.com/). Mr. Siefen is the head coach of our FRC team and helps maintain the websites and provides hosting costs for the team.
