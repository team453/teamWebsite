### Why Sponsor our Team?

We do various fundraisers in addition to recruiting sponsors, but there are other perks to sponsorship that fundraising does not provide. For example, when we reach out for sponsorship to local businesses it builds a relationship between the students and that business. In some cases sponsors will actually help mentor the team and assist in building the robot, providing custom parts or even provide catering for a meeting. It gives businesses advertising at our competitions and in our school. It also gives businesses access to students interested in their field and give companies the inside track with our students when they graduate.

### How to Sponsor

If you are interested in sponsoring our team, please contact us at our [business email](mailto:team453.firstrobotics@gmail.com). We will send you a sponsorship packet with more information about our team and what we can offer you in return for your sponsorship.
