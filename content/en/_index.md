## What is FRC?

To quote F.I.R.S.T. (For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology):
>"Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team."

## What is FRC 453?

First Robotics Competition Team 453 is a combined team for the L'Anse Creuse Public School District and its sending school partners. We have students from other local schools that do NOT have a team of their own. We meet out of our districts CTE building and have been in existence since 2000. The team is coached by Industry Mentors, and occasionally has a teacher or two on the team. We are a team of students, parents, and mentors that work together to build a robot, teach business/engineering skills, and have fun. Students can learn from many subjects such as:

* Engineering
* Business
* Marketing
* Programming
* CAD
* Manufacturing
* Welding
* Electronics
* Graphic Design
* Safety
* and more!

## What's the goal of FRC 453?

Rock’Em Sock'Em Robotics strives to be the best student-led robotics team while having fun. Our team members are mentored by industry professionals, allowing them to develop the skills necessary to compete in the workforce by designing, building, coding, and competing our robots. We pride ourselves on effectively working as a team by brainstorming, communicating, and being gracious professionals.
